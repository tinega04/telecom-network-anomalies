## 📊 Network Performance Analytics (10-Minute IP Aggregates)

This project analyzes network usage over 10-minute intervals to identify abnormal spikes or drops in flows, packets, and bytes transferred. It applies rolling averages and Z-score anomaly detection to highlight unusual patterns, potentially indicating security breaches or performance bottlenecks.

### ✅ Key Features
- Time-based trend visualization (flows, packets, bytes)
- Anomaly detection using Z-scores
- Output visualizations and CSVs for reporting

### 📁 Outputs
- Cleaned data: `processed_network_data.csv`
- Anomalies: `network_anomalies.csv`
- Visuals: `network_activity_over_time.png`, `flow_anomalies.png`
